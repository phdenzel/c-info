#+TITLE: c-info
#+AUTHOR: phdenzel

  A few short C programs that print out some basic info on types, structs, arrays, and loops.

  It also includes some basic SDL programs which could get someone started on a self-programmed game...
  /Hint/: try the arrows on your keyboard when running ~sdl_runtime~.

*** Compile
    
    To compile the info programs, type in the terminal for example:
    #+BEGIN_SRC shell :exports none
      gcc -o info_types info_types.c
      chmod 755 info_types
      ./info_types
    #+END_SRC
  
    To compile the SDL examples, run the command:
    #+BEGIN_SRC shell :export none
      ./make_sdl.sh
    #+END_SRC

    This compiles the programs, if the necessart SDL libraries have been installed.
